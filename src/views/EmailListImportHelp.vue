    <p>To prepare your file for import, follow these steps:</p>

    <p>3. Next to your Email Address column, create and label additional columns for First Name and Last Name.</p>
    <p>
      Email address is the only field that we require, but you can repeat this step for any other contact data fields
      you want to included.

      5. Save the file in CSV format. This option can usually be access from the File menu in your spreadsheet program,
      labeled as “Export as .CSV” or “Download as .CSV”.
